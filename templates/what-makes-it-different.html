                Almost all information has a geographical dimension,
                but it is very difficult to describe it in purely verbal
                terms.

                long a textual guide would you need to find your way

                Maptionnaire was born from the realization that
                questionnaire tools without a map are unusable for
                questions starting with <i>“Where ...?”</i>

            <p>
            From an urban planner’s point of view, participation is
            often driven by questions: you need to know what the
            locals know and think, and the best way to find out is to
            ask them.

                Where is a connection needed?
                Which areas need renovation?
                Where do people feel unsafe?... </i>

            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bringing residents together at workshops is time
                consuming and expensive, and only a handful of people
                get to have their say.</li>
                <li>In contrast, online tools allow the participation of
                thousands of people at low cost.</li>
                <li>Different, wider groups of people can participate online</li>
                <li>High quality data gathered validates planning choices
                and helps discussions with the participants.</li>
